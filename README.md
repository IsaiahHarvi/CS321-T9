**`Repository for the Hotel Database Management Sytem.`**

<!-- Just for neatness sake lets outline a program description here after its complete.  -->

### Description
The hotel management database software is a user-friendly Java application that utilizes SQLLite as its back-end database. It eliminates the need for a front desk person by allowing users to easily view room availability, pricing, and occupancy information. Additionally, the software keeps track of whether rooms are pet-friendly or designated as smoking or non-smoking. This software streamlines the hotel management process and makes it more efficient.
